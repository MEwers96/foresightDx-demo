NOTES:

Unfortunately I spent WAY too much time trying to fight HTML/CSS which was quite a let down. In result of doing so, I was un able to complete the results page. Along with the results page, I did not complete the Mass gathering function. I also got close with the REGEX checking system, but looks like I did not quite crack the code. 

The result will print out to the console once the function runs on a string. 



To run this Python web application, you will need to cd into "src" and run 
the command Python app.py. 

The web will start on localhost:8001. Enter this into your browser.

The front page will land and you will be able to try out the sequence analysis!
